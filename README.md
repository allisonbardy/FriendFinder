# Compatibility-based "FriendFinder" Application

Friend Finder application is meant to be similar to a daating app. User answers a 10-question survey with options of selecting 1 (strongly disagree) through 5 (strongly agree). After submitting those responses, the total score from their responses is compared with the total score of other users' responses. The user with the smallest difference in total score is presented as their best match and most compatible friend.
